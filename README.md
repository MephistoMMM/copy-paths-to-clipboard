#Copy Paths to Clipboard

![Copy Paths to Clipboard Screenshot](screenshots/copypaths_paths.png)


Workflow for Alfred 2 to copy the paths of your current files and Documents to the clipboard in a variety of formats: 

* POSIX or HFS paths 
* '~/'-shortened POSIX paths
* quoted paths
* comma- or newline-separated.

All options (except newline-separation) are available as File Actions also.

## Usage

Invoke the scriptfilter by typing **`paths`**. If you are in Finder, the path(s) of your current Finder item(s) or selection will be copied to the clipboard, if you're in an other (document-based) application the path of your frontmost document will be copied. The scriptfilter will give you feedback as to how exactly your path will be copied upon actioning your input in the subtitle.

### Options

By default and without using any of the options, paths will be copied as as-is slash-delimited POSIX paths:

	/Users/UserName/Documents/File.txt

**`hfs`** copies your path as an HFS path.
	
	Macintosh HD:Users:UserName:Documents:File.txt


**`-s`** '~/'-shortens paths under user home. Applies to POSIX paths only.

	~/Documents/File.txt


**`-q`** copies paths with quotes. 
POSIX paths will be quoted using single quotes. 	

	'/Users/UserName/Documents/File.txt'
	
HFS paths will be quoted using double quotes with **`-q`**.

	"Macintosh HD:Users:UserName:Documents:File.txt"

**`-n`** will put each path on a new line if you have multiple paths. 

	/Users/UserName/Documents/File1.txt
	/Users/UserName/Documents/File2.txt

By default, multiple paths will be comma separated.

	/Users/UserName/Documents/File1.txt, /Users/UserName/Documents/File2.txt
	
All options can be combined.
The scriptfilter subtitle will update the path as it will be copied as per your current options (if you're using **`-n`**, obviously only the first path will be visible)


### File Actions

This Workflow also adds File Actions for all the options above except newline-separation. Each of these File Actions accept multiple items (use [alt]-[arrow-up] to add an item to your selection, [alt]-[arrow-right] to display File Actions for your selection of multiple items).

### Changelog
######*** June 18, 2013***

Add support for paths containing non-ASCII/Unicode characters in the scriptfilter (use quoted option `-q` if you're copying such paths for the Terminal)
